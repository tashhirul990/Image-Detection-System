# Image Detection System

## Overview
The **Image Detection System** is a project designed to identify and classify objects within images using advanced machine learning and computer vision techniques. This system aims to provide accurate and efficient image recognition capabilities for various applications.

## Features
- Object detection and classification.
- Support for multiple image formats.
- High accuracy using state-of-the-art algorithms.
- Scalable and customizable for different use cases.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries/Frameworks**: TensorFlow, OpenCV, NumPy
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Docker (optional)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/image-detection-system.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd image-detection-system
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Place your images in the `input` folder.
